Hi, im a freelancer for a kids educational company and i was asked to make a game on Javascript and Html where I upload an image and the background of the screen is colored with the main color present in the image, also image uploaded should convert into an image puzzle, breaking the image on parts, organizing them randomly in a box, and giving each part the ability to be drag and dropped with the mouse for getting correctly organized by the player. Please help me with that.
I want you to generate the code in strict compliance with the following structure:

```javascript
function initializeModule() {}

function getDominantColor(img) {}

function createPuzzlePieces(img) {}

function drawPuzzle() {}

function handleImageUpload(e) {}

module.exports = {
  createPuzzlePieces,
  handleImageUpload,
  getDominantColor,
  drawPuzzle,
  initializeModule,
  getPuzzlePieces: () => puzzlePieces,
  getGridSize: () => gridSize,
};
```

Assume that the body of the html file is:

```html
<input type="file" id="imageUpload" />
<div id="puzzleContainer" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;">
  <canvas id="puzzleCanvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
</div>
```
